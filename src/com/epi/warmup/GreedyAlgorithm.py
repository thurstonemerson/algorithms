The programming exercises in EPI are representative of what you will be asked
in an interview. We do not provide textbook-style review questions.
  
We present a small set of programming exercises suitable
for someone who needs to review basics. (You are unlikely to be asked these
questions - their purpose is to bootstrap reading EPI.)

When you write your solutions to these exercises, please code to the
following constraints:
 
- Do not use library calls. 
- Do not try to design clever solutions. (This means it is fine to use brute-force approaches.) 
- Assume valid inputs, and ignore internal errors like overflow, IO exceptions, etc. 
- Write unit tests for your programs. 
- Analyze your programs for time and space complexity.

   Greedy Algorithms and Invariants: Write a program that takes an input a positive integer
   N, and returns the minimum number of coins in the US coinage system to create N cents. For example, if
   N = 37, the answer is 4, corresponding to a quarter, a dime, and two pennies.'''
