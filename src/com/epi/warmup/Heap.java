/**
 * The programming exercises in EPI are representative of what you will be asked
 * in an interview. We do not provide textbook-style review questions.
 * 
 * We present a small set of programming exercises suitable
 * for someone who needs to review basics. (You are unlikely to be asked these
 * questions - their purpose is to bootstrap reading EPI.)
 * 
 * When you write your solutions to these exercises, please code to the
 * following constraints:
 * 
 * - Do not use library calls. 
 * - Do not try to design clever solutions. (This means it is fine to use brute-force approaches.) 
 * - Assume valid inputs, and ignore internal errors like overflow, IO exceptions, etc. 
 * - Write unit tests for your programs. 
 * - Analyze your programs for time and space complexity.
